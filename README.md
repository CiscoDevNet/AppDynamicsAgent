# AppDynamicsAgent iOS SDK

An AppDynamics iOS SDK framework for monitoring the performance and activity of iOS applications. This SDK can be added to your Xcode development environment via the AppDynamics [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/AppDynamicsAgent.git).

> ⚠️ This project contains a single manifest file `Package.swift`, and there are no future plans to include any source code. As such, it is unlikely that we will be accepting contributions to the project, as its primary purpose is for binary distribution.
